# Chat-App

This is a final interview project that gained me a software engineer position at `Ezoic`. This app was built in a single day using vanilla Javascript,
HTML, CSS for the frontend and Node, Express, Socket.io for the backend. The chat app includes additional quality of life features, such as a typing
indicator that shows whether a person in the chat room is typing into the text box, messaging timestamp, and a backend storage system that stores all
of the send messages in a chat room.
